If you feel a strong earthquake or extended ground rolling take immediate protective actions such as moving inland and/or uphill preferably by foot.  Boat operators:    Where time and conditions permit, move your boat out to sea to a depth of at least 180 feet.    If at sea avoid entering shallow water, harbors, marinas, bays, and inlets to avoid floating and submerged debris, and strong currents.  Do not go to the shore to observe the tsunami.
